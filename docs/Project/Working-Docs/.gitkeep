# Working Docs Directory

This directory is for temporary working documents that are generated during development but should not be committed to the repository.

Files in this directory are ignored by Git (see .gitignore) but the directory structure is preserved with this .gitkeep file.

## Usage
- AI-generated temporary documents
- Work-in-progress documentation
- Brainstorming notes
- Task completion summaries

## Cleanup
Remember to clean up this directory before major commits or when passing projects to other team members.
