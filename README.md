## Project Overview

The External Tracking System is designed to monitor and track external resources, services, and dependencies. This system provides visibility into third-party integrations, API usage, and external service health.

### Key Features
- **External Service Monitoring**: Track availability and performance of external APIs and services
- **Dependency Management**: Monitor and manage third-party library and service dependencies
- **Usage Analytics**: Track and analyze usage patterns of external resources
- **Alert Management**: Proactive notifications for external service issues
- **Historical Data**: Maintain historical records of external service performance
- **ClickUp Task Tracking**: Real-time web interface for viewing ClickUp tasks and subtasks with status, assignments, and progress tracking

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ or Python 3.11+ (depending on implementation)
- Git
- Access to external service APIs (credentials will be configured)

### Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Wise-Owl-Automation/external-tracking.git
   cd external-tracking
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   # For Node.js projects
   npm install
   
   # For Python projects
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your configuration
   ```

4. Review documentation structure:
   ```bash
   # Explore the docs folder
   ls -la docs/
   ```

### For AI Development
When working with AI tools on this project, always include:
- **This README** for project context and navigation
- **[`/docs/SOPs/Coding-Standards.md`](docs/SOPs/Coding-Standards.md)** for development standards
- **Relevant system documentation** from [`/docs/System/`](docs/System/) based on the task

## Development Standards

### Code Quality
- Follow the coding standards defined in [`/docs/SOPs/Coding-Standards.md`](docs/SOPs/Coding-Standards.md)
- Write self-documenting code with clear naming conventions
- Include unit tests for new functionality
- Document known issues and workarounds in code comments

### Version Control
- **Main Branch**: Always deployable, protected
- **Feature Branches**: `feature/description-of-feature`
- **Rebase Strategy**: Always rebase on main before pushing
- **Commit Messages**: Clear, descriptive, action-oriented

### Documentation
- Keep README under 500 lines for AI context efficiency
- Use Mermaid charts for visual documentation
- Update system documentation when making architectural changes
- Archive completed project documentation in [`/docs/Project/Archive/`](docs/Project/Archive/)

## Available Tools and Integrations

### Development Tools
- **GitHub CLI**: For issue management and repository operations
- **Mermaid**: For diagram generation and visualization
- **API Testing**: Postman/Insomnia collections for external API testing

- **Product Management**: Usage analytics and cost optimization
- **Security Team**: External service security and compliance

### Technical Stack
- **Backend**: [To be determined - Node.js/Python/Go]
- **Database**: [To be determined - PostgreSQL/MongoDB]
- **Message Queue**: [To be determined - Redis/RabbitMQ]
- **Monitoring**: [To be determined - Prometheus/Datadog]
- **Deployment**: Docker containers on cloud infrastructure
- **Web Interface**: Next.js with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS (ClickUp integration)

- Performance degradation alerts

## ClickUp Integration ✅ COMPLETED

The [`/web-app`](web-app/) directory contains a **fully operational** Next.js application that provides a real-time web interface for viewing ClickUp tasks and subtasks. This integration is **live and working** with the RealSavvy project list.

### 🎯 Features (All Implemented)
- **✅ Task Overview**: Display tasks and subtasks in exact ClickUp-like interface
- **✅ Real-time Data**: Live synchronization with ClickUp API (currently displaying 12 tasks, 57 subtasks)
- **✅ Filtered Views**: Shows only open tasks, excludes closed items automatically
- **✅ Comprehensive Info**: Task names, time estimates, developers, status, due dates, priorities, and comment counts
- **✅ Hierarchical Display**: Subtasks appear under their parent tasks with expand/collapse functionality
- **✅ Professional UI**: Clean, responsive design matching ClickUp's interface
- **✅ Error Handling**: Graceful handling of API rate limits and connection issues

### 🚀 Current Status
- **LIVE**: Application running at http://localhost:3000
- **CONNECTED**: Successfully integrated with ClickUp API
- **DATA**: Displaying real tasks from RealSavvy list (ID: 901409484294)
- **TESTED**: Fully functional with proper error handling

### Quick Start
```bash
cd web-app
npm install
cp .env.local.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local with your ClickUp API credentials
npm run dev
# Visit http://localhost:3000 to view your tasks
```

### 🔧 Technical Implementation
- **Framework**: Next.js 15 with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- **API Integration**: Complete ClickUp API v2 client with authentication
- **Components**: Reusable TaskList and TaskRow components
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript definitions for ClickUp data structures
- **Performance**: Efficient data processing with graceful rate limit handling

### Deployment
The web app is **ready for production** and configured for easy deployment to Vercel with environment variable management for ClickUp API credentials.
